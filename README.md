### version 2 (2025)
In 2025, both fonts recieved a complete redesign. In version 1, TASA Orbiter included an optical size axis, which is removed in v2. The number of styles is reduced from 13 to 5.
Both fonts now support the Google Fonts Core Latin character set, plus additional glyphs to support Taiwanese Romanizations ([Tâi-lô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2i-u%C3%A2n_L%C3%B4-m%C3%A1-j%C4%AB_Phing-im_Hong-%C3%A0n) & [POJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB))
